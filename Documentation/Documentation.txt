Day 1
Installed the Project and Runned on Visual Studio, The Project Did not Build because of Compilation Errors 
Such as: 1>d:\teste kokku\autobattlec++\character.h(30): error C2061: syntax error: identifier 'vector'

I'll now try to Fix some of those Bugs

(Character.h) Fixed the Vector bug, missing include and namespace std

Battlefield.cpp -> Fixed the Switch Bug.

Noticed that Many Parts of the Code there is a use of using namespace std and then using std:: , this needs to be organized to keep the same pattern to every code
